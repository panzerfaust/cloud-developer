# Serverless TODO Project

This project is a basic note taking application called Serverless TODO. It allows authenticated users to input and store notes that you type, attach images, mark tasks as done, and delete a task. It was created during the Udacity Cloud Developer Nanodegree.

The frontend is a react client that runs locally and the backend is written in Typescript and runs on AWS.

# Functionality of the application

This application allows 
 - creating/removing/updating/fetching TODO items. 
 - Each TODO item can optionally have an attachment image. 
 - Each user only has access to TODO items that he/she has created through Auth0 authorisation.
 - AWS x-ray is implemented to trace the system
 - Winston is implemented for logging
 - The system can be tested offline by emulating DynamoDB and serverless

# How to run the application

## Backend

To deploy an application run the following commands:

```
cd backend
npm install
sls deploy -v
```

## Frontend

To run a client application first edit the `client/src/config.ts` file to set correct parameters. You will need to have first deployed your serverless application and created and Auth0 account.

```ts
const apiId = '...' API Gateway id // Get from your endpoint
export const apiEndpoint = `https://${apiId}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`

export const authConfig = {
  domain: '...',    // Domain from Auth0
  clientId: '...',  // Client id from an Auth0 application
  callbackUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/callback'
}
```
And then run the following commands:

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless TODO application.

# TODO items

Each TODO item contains the following fields:

* `todoId` (string) - a unique id for an item
* `createdAt` (string) - date and time when an item was created
* `name` (string) - name of a TODO item (e.g. "Change a light bulb")
* `dueDate` (string) - date and time by which an item should be completed
* `done` (boolean) - true if an item was completed, false otherwise
* `attachmentUrl` (string) - a URL pointing to an image attached to a TODO item
* `userId` (string) - Id of authorised person who created TODO item

# Function Descriptions

* `Auth` - this function implements a custom authorizer for API Gateway using Auth0.

* `GetTodos` - return all TODOs for a current user. A user id can be extracted from a JWT token that is sent by the frontend

It returns data that looks like this:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "todoId": "123",
      "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",
      "name": "Buy milk",
      "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
      "done": false,
      "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

* `CreateTodo` - creates a new TODO for a current user. A shape of data send by a client application to this function can be found in the `CreateTodoRequest.ts` file

It receives a new TODO item to be created in JSON format that looks like this:

```json
{
  "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",
  "name": "Buy milk",
  "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
  "done": false,
  "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"
}
```

It returns a new TODO item that looks like this:

```json
{
  "item": {
    "todoId": "123",
    "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",
    "name": "Buy milk",
    "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
    "done": false,
    "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"
  }
}
```

* `UpdateTodo` - updates a TODO item created by a current user. A shape of data send by a client application to this function can be found in the `UpdateTodoRequest.ts` file

It receives an object that contains three fields that can be updated in a TODO item:

```json
{
  "name": "Buy bread",
  "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
  "done": true
}
```

The id of an item that should be updated is passed as a URL parameter.

It should return an empty body.

* `DeleteTodo` - deletes a TODO item created by a current user. Expects an id of a TODO item to remove.

It should return an empty body.

* `GenerateUploadUrl` - returns a pre-signed URL that can be used to upload an attachment file for a TODO item.

It should return a JSON object that looks like this:

```json
{
  "uploadUrl": "https://s3-bucket-name.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/image.png"
}
```

All functions are already connected to appropriate events from API Gateway.
